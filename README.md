# pan-tb-modeling
Code used to conduct modeling and cost analysis of novel pan-TB treatment regimens. 

Order to run scripts:

1. Run model (run_model.R) 
2. Estimate incidence from model output (estimate_incidence.R). 
3. Update model output based on changing cohort sizes from incidence estimates (run_final_calcs.R). 
4. Calculate price thresholds (calc_thresholds.R). 
5. Calculate means and confidence intervals of raw output (summarize_output.R)

All scripts are set up to run on a high-performance computing cluster.
